This is the main file for the python scripts used to perform analysis on the .lhe files produced during a MADGraph5 run.
Currently this file is setup to help output datasets that can be used to train models which search of top topbar processes in particle events.
The idea of this file is to allow the uses to do most of the analysis without having to open all the Python files and run multiple command line instructions.
Currently the file contains the following functions:
ConvertAndAnalyse: This function will prompt the user to select a folder containing the raw .lhe files produced from a MADGraph5 run and convert the files to text documents. It will produce three text documents, the first is simply the raw data in text form. The second contains information about the pseudorapidities of the particles. Finally a third file is created with all the particles in an event combineid into one event with data associated to the event from the particles that contain an IST code of 1. The function will then run a feature and PC analysis on the data in the event datafile. Finally it will perform a shrinkage analysis using both logistic regression and XGBoost.
